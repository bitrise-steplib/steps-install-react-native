title: Install React Native  
summary: Installs the React Native CLI tools.
description: |-
  The Step installs the React Native command line tools with npm. 
  It exposes the `react-native` binary, so you can call `yarn react-native` or `npx react-native` directly from your project.
    
  ### Configuring the Step
  
  You can set which version of the CLI you want to use, and add any additional options to the `npm install` command.
  
  1. In the **Version of the `react-native-cli` package to install**, set the version you need.
    
     For example, set it to `0.9.1`. If you leave the input empty, the Step will use the latest version.
     
  2. In the **Additional options when installing React Native CLI with `npm install`** input, set any additional flags you want to use with the `npm-install` command.
  
     The default is set to `global`. You can use multiple options, separated by a space.
